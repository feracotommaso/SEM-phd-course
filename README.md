Structural Equation Modeling

This is a GitHub repository that supports the course Structural Equation Modeling. 
This is an introductory course for the PhD program in Psychological Sciences (University of Padova). 

We will navigate the basic concepts of SEM the every researcher in the social sciences and psychology should know. The course will adopt a practical and theoretical rather than strictly statistical perspectives to advance everyone's understanding of the topic and its deeper meanings.
Some advanced topics will be introduced during lessons, but curious students could use the additional materials to learn more if they want.
