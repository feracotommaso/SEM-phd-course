## Today in the workflow

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Welcome deck (today):** logistics + course map + how we’ll work  
**Next deck (01):** workflow + lavaan foundations (from *Specify → Identify → Estimate → Evaluate → Revise/Report*)
:::

---

## Who is this course for?

- Psychology PhD students with **solid R skills**
- You’ve run regressions/GLMs; you want to **model constructs + relations** with SEM
- You’re willing to think in **models** (not just tests)

---

## Why am I here?

I am convinced that SEM is a fundamental tool for research in psychology
and most, if not all, researchers in this area should know it. Indeed,
it is key for many aspects of your research:

-   Measurement
-   Multivariate analyses
-   Complex regression models
-   Longitudinal analyses
-   ...

--- 

## What you’ll be able to do (by the end)

- Translate a verbal theory into a **diagram** and a **lavaan model**
- Evaluate **global fit** *and* **local misfit** (and respecify responsibly)
- Fit and report:
  - path models / mediation
  - CFA and SEM (measurement + structure)
  - invariance (MG-CFA), ordinal SEM, longitudinal and clustered strategies
- Produce **reproducible reports** (Quarto + a reporting checklist)

---

## Course contents (big picture)

We will (hopefully) cover:

1. lavaan workflow + foundations  
2. Path analysis & mediation (equivalence and interpretation)  
3. Model fit & diagnostics (global vs local; disciplined respecification)  
4. CFA (measurement first; reliability/validity)  
5. Full SEM (measurement + structural part; capstone)  
6. Measurement invariance (MG-CFA; partial invariance)  
7. Ordinal SEM (thresholds; WLSMV/ULS; ordinal invariance)  
8. Missing/robustness/reporting (FIML/MI; robust SE; write-up)  
9. Longitudinal SEM (growth + invariance over time)  
10. Clustered/multilevel strategies (robust SE; two-level CFA)

---

## What we will *not* focus on (in live sessions)

- EFA (we’ll mention it, but we are **not** doing an EFA course)
- Bayesian SEM (optional extra)
- Advanced/rare models (optional extras: latent interactions, SAM/MIIVs, etc.)

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
If you need something specific for your project, park it as a “parking lot question”: we’ll map it to the right module (live vs extra).
:::

---

## Format: 5 mornings × 4 hours

Each morning is split into **two 2-hour blocks**:

- **Block A:** concepts + live coding (short, focused)
- **Block B:** guided exercises → lab handout (you work; we troubleshoot)

---

## The repository is the course

**SEM-phd-course** is a Quarto website + source files:

- `/slides/` revealjs decks (what you see in class)
- `/labs/` hands-on labs (what you do)
- `/extras/` self-study modules (what you can revisit)
- `/R/` helper functions (fit, plots, reporting)

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Goal: everything is “book-ready”: coherent headings, reproducible code, and consistent reporting.
:::

---

## How to use materials during class

1. Keep the **slides** open (concepts + code snippets)
2. Work in the **lab** file in parallel (copy/adapt code)
3. When stuck:
   - identify *where* you are in the workflow (Specify / Identify / Estimate / Evaluate / Revise-Report)
   - bring the smallest reproducible example

---

## Software checklist (do this before we start)

- R (recent), RStudio
- Quarto
- Packages (minimum):
  - `lavaan`, `semTools`, `semPlot`, `tidyverse`, `quarto`
- Optional but useful:
  - `psych`, `MVN`, `performance`, `broom`, `parameters`

```{r}
#| label: pkg-check
#| eval: false
pkgs <- c("lavaan","semTools","semPlot","tidyverse")
to_install <- pkgs[!pkgs %in% rownames(installed.packages())]
if(length(to_install)) install.packages(to_install)
```

---

## Ground rules (so this is actually useful)

- **Measurement-first (“two-step mindset”)**: measure → then relate constructs  
- **Fit ≠ truth**: use theory + diagnostics; respecify with discipline  
- Prefer **transparent reporting** over “hunting for good fit”

---

## What I need from you

- Bring a dataset and one research question (even if rough)
- Be ready to:
  - draw your model
  - state *what would falsify it*
  - accept that “good fit” can still be a bad model

---

## Parking lot questions

If your question is:

- **about your own project’s model** → keep it; we’ll connect it to a module  
- **about R/lavaan syntax** → ask immediately  
- **about advanced variants** (Bayesian, latent interactions, MIIVs, etc.) → likely an *extra*

---

## Take-home: 3 things

1. This course is about a **workflow**, not a list of models  
2. We will treat SEM as **measurement + structure**, in that order  
3. The repo is your **long-term reference** (slides, labs, extras, helpers)

---

## Next

**Next deck (01):** SEM foundations + workflow + lavaan basics  
→ we start coding immediately.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Open the repo, run the package check, and make sure Quarto renders.
