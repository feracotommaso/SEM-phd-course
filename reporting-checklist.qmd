title: "Reporting checklist"
---

Use this as a copy/paste checklist for assignments, papers, and thesis chapters.

## Always report (any SEM/CFA)

- **Software + version** (R, lavaan, semTools, etc.)
- **Sample size (N)** and any exclusions
- **Variables** (which indicators for each factor; scales; whether ordinal)
- **Estimator** (ML / MLR / WLSMV etc.) + justification
- **Missing data handling** (FIML / MI / listwise) + justification
- **Model syntax** (append or supplement)
- **Model identification choices** (marker vs `std.lv=TRUE`, constraints, etc.)
- **Global fit**: χ²(df), CFI/TLI, RMSEA (+ CI), SRMR
- **Key parameters**: estimates + SE/CI + standardized solution (when meaningful)
- **Interpretation** tied to the research question
- **Diagnostics**: what you checked (residuals, MI/EPC) and what you changed (if anything)
- **Reproducibility**: session info (and seed if simulation)

## CFA-specific

- Factor loadings (unstd + std), indicator residual variances
- Factor variances/covariances
- Reliability: ω (omega) and/or other chosen indices (with method stated)
- Handling of **cross-loadings / correlated residuals**:
  - were any added?
  - what was the substantive rationale?
  - was this preregistered / cross-validated / replicated?

## SEM (structural) specific

- Structural paths (standardized + CI)
- R² for endogenous variables
- Indirect effects:
  - method (bootstrap recommended when appropriate)
  - effect + CI + interpretation (avoid “p-value only” reporting)
- Clarify causal language:
  - observational vs experimental
  - identification assumptions (temporal ordering, confounding, etc.)

## Multi-group / invariance

- Groups (definition, Ns per group)
- Invariance steps tested:
  - configural, metric, scalar (and strict if used)
- What constraints were imposed at each step
- Decision rules used (e.g., ΔCFI / ΔRMSEA thresholds) and references for your rule
- If partial invariance:
  - which parameters freed
  - rationale (substantive + statistical)
  - what comparisons remain interpretable (e.g., latent means only after (partial) scalar)

## Ordinal indicators

- Which variables treated as ordered
- Estimator and link (e.g., WLSMV / probit-type default framework)
- Thresholds vs intercepts (make clear what was constrained in invariance)
- Fit interpretation caveat: note if thresholds or residual structures drive misfit
- Sensitivity check (optional but strong): treat as continuous vs ordered and compare conclusions

## Longitudinal SEM

- Time points and spacing
- Whether you tested **longitudinal measurement invariance**
- How you handled correlated uniqueness (same items across time)
- For growth models:
  - coding of slope loadings (0,1,2… or actual time)
  - random effects included (intercept/slope variance)
- For cross-lagged models:
  - clarify whether you used CLPM vs alternatives (if relevant)
  - interpret cross-lagged paths cautiously

## Clustered / multilevel

- Clustering variable (e.g., class, clinic, therapist) and cluster sizes
- Strategy used:
  - cluster-robust SE (and why sufficient), or
  - explicit multilevel model (within/between)
- If multilevel:
  - which parameters vary within vs between
  - ICC motivation (optional but helpful)

## A short “results paragraph” template

> “We fit a [CFA/SEM] using lavaan (version …) with estimator … . Missing data were handled using … . Model fit was [acceptable/problematic] (χ²(df)=…, CFI=…, RMSEA=… [CI], SRMR=…). The key effect of interest was … (β=…, 95% CI […, …]). Diagnostics indicated … ; we [did/did not] respecify the model. Results suggest …, with limitations including … .”

**Rule of thumb**  
If you changed the model after looking at the data, state exactly what you changed and why. “Transparency beats perfection.”
