Short definitions + “what students usually confuse it with”.

## A

**Absolute fit**  
Fit measures that evaluate how well the model reproduces the observed covariance structure (e.g., χ², SRMR).

**AIC / BIC**  
Information criteria for comparing models (typically non-nested too). Lower is better (with caveats).

## C

**CFA (Confirmatory Factor Analysis)**  
A measurement model where latent variables explain covariances among observed indicators via factor loadings.

**CFI / TLI**  
Incremental fit indices comparing your model to a baseline (independence) model.

**Cluster-robust standard errors**  
A correction to SEs/p-values when observations are clustered (e.g., students in classrooms) without explicitly fitting a multilevel model.

**Configural / Metric / Scalar invariance**  
Levels of measurement invariance across groups/time:
- configural: same pattern of loadings
- metric: equal loadings
- scalar: equal loadings + intercepts (or thresholds for ordinal)

## D

**DWLS / WLSMV**  
Common estimators for ordinal indicators. Naming can be confusing: the practical takeaway is that ordinal models often use a weighted least squares approach with robust corrections.

## E

**Equivalent models**  
Different path diagrams that imply the same covariance structure (same global fit). Fit alone cannot identify the “true” causal story.

**EPC (Expected Parameter Change)**  
How much a parameter estimate would change if a fixed constraint were freed; often reported with modification indices.

## F

**FIML (Full Information Maximum Likelihood)**  
A likelihood-based approach to handle missing data under MAR assumptions (with ML-family estimators).

**Fit indices (global)**  
Summaries of how well the overall model fits (CFI/TLI/RMSEA/SRMR/χ²).

**Fit indices (local)**  
Diagnostics for specific parts of a model (residuals, MI/EPC, standardized residual covariances).

## I

**Identification**  
Whether model parameters can be uniquely estimated from the data (rules of thumb help, but do not guarantee identification).

**Intercepts vs thresholds (ordinal)**  
- Intercepts: continuous indicator mean structure
- Thresholds: cut-points that map a continuous latent response to ordinal categories

## L

**Latent variable**  
Unobserved construct inferred from observed indicators.

**Latent interaction**  
An interaction between latent variables (e.g., F1 × F2 predicting Y). Estimation/interpretation differs from standard linear SEM.

## M

**Measurement model**  
The part of SEM that links indicators to latent factors (loadings, intercepts/thresholds, residual variances).

**MI (Modification Index)**  
A statistic indicating how much χ² would drop if a fixed parameter were freed. Useful but easy to abuse.

**Missingness (MCAR/MAR/MNAR)**  
Assumptions about why data are missing:
- MCAR: unrelated to observed/unobserved variables
- MAR: related to observed variables
- MNAR: related to unobserved values themselves

## R

**RMSEA**  
A parsimony-adjusted fit index; usually reported with a confidence interval.

## S

**SAM (Structural After Measurement)**  
A two-stage estimation strategy: estimate measurement first, then structural relations using implied latent moments.

**SEM (Structural Equation Model)**  
An integrated model including both measurement (latent variables) and structural relations (regressions/covariances among latents/observeds).

**SRMR**  
A fit index based on standardized residuals (difference between observed and model-implied covariances/correlations).

## T

**Two-step mindset**  
A practical workflow: evaluate measurement quality before interpreting structural relations.
