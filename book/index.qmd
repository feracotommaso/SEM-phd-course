Welcome! This book is a practical introduction to **Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)** for psychological research, with examples in **R** (mainly using **lavaan**).

This book is built from the course materials in the companion repository and is designed to be:

- **Applied** (hands-on, code-driven)
- **Measurement-aware** (CFA, reliability, invariance are central)
- **Transparent** (reproducible code; reporting checklist)
- **Expandable** (advanced topics are available as optional sections)

If you're following the course, use this book as a **reference** when doing labs and assignments.

## How to read this book

- If you are new to SEM: read chapters **1–5** in order.
- If you already know basics: jump to the chapter you need (ordinal, invariance, longitudinal, multilevel).
- Each chapter ends with:
  - a *summary of key points*
  - *common pitfalls*
  - *exercises* (optional)

## What you should know already

- Comfortable with R (data wrangling, plotting, writing functions)
- Linear regression basics
- Correlation/covariance intuition

## Companion materials

- **Slides and labs**: see the course GitHub Pages site
- **Glossary**: key terms and common confusions
- **Reporting checklist**: copy-paste guidance for papers and theses
- **Extras**: optional modules (power, latent interactions, SAM today's methods, etc.)

## Book roadmap

- **Foundations**: SEM logic, identification intuition, estimation choices, lavaan grammar
- **Path analysis**: regression models in SEM form, mediation, equivalent models
- **Fit & diagnostics**: global vs local fit, residuals, MI discipline
- **CFA**: measurement models, identification strategies, reliability
- **SEM**: measurement + structure, two-step mindset, applied workflow
- **Extensions**: missing data, invariance, ordinal SEM, longitudinal, multilevel
- **Appendices**: lavaan recipes + reporting templates
